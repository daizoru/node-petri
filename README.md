===============

*a multi-agent system based on node-evolve*


## In short

Substrate is a work-in-progress, alpha framework to bootstrap the development of multi-agent systems on the Node plateform. 

It is based on node-evolve, a library to do Genetic Programming in JavaScript.

The name substrate has been chosen as a substitute for "agar agar", a biomaterial used to cultivate bacterias in vitro.

## Description

Node-subtrate provides logic for designing, distributing and mutating agents, as well as additional tools for building real-world apps.

For instance, it provide a database to store the "DNA" of agents, and a penalty-based error system to help reducing propagation of bad algorithms among the offspring.

All these tools are (or will be, in future version) optional, customizable and substituable, since the main goal of this project is to integrate nicely with other robotic frameworks, as well as leveraging the growing Node ecosystem.

## Installation

    $ npm install substrate

## Usage

To be continued. For the moment please see the examples.
